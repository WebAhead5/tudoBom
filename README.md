# Task

To build a To Do list using <span style="color:blue">**Test Driven Development**</span>, making sure the following are incorprated:
- enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them :heavy_check_mark:
- view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day :heavy_check_mark:
- mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left :heavy_check_mark:
- the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb :heavy_check_mark:

The key here was to use <span style="color:blue">**Pure Functions**</span> that could be easily unit tested to ensure that our code was running correctly at all times.

We added addtional functionality in that the "done" items and the "not done" items are also presented into seperate lists so that the user can clearly see what tasks are left to do :heavy_check_mark:

We also added the ability to sort the list via a drop down in both date and alphabetical order :heavy_check_mark:
