# Task

To build a To Do list using <span style="color:blue">**Test Driven Development**</span>, making sure the following are incorprated:
- enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
- view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
- mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
- the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb

The key here was to use <span style="color:blue">**Pure Functions**</span> that could be easily unit tested to ensure that our code was running correctly at all times.
